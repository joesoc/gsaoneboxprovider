#summary Interfaces to implement a concrete provider for a content source.

= Introduction =

The GSA OneBox Provider acts as a small framework to easily implement a concrete provider for a content source. To do that there are only two slim interfaces to implement. 
A pretty easy example can be found with the dummy provider located in package 'com.qperior.gsa.oneboxprovider.implementations.dummy'.

= Details =

One interface represents the provider itself ('QPIProvider') and the other encapsulates all security features of the provider.
It might be a good idea to combine both to one interface; but at the moment I decided to separate them.
