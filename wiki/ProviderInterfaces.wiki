= Introduction =

The GSA OneBox Provider acts as a small framework to easily implement concrete provider for different content sources. To do that there are only two slim interfaces to implement. 
A pretty easy example can be found with the dummy provider located in package 'com.qperior.gsa.oneboxprovider.implementations.dummy'.
