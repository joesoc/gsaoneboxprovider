Setting up the project in the GSA and in Eclipse to test and build it.

= Details =

==Setting up the project in Eclipse==
Just check out the project in Eclipse; everything should be OK (sources should be build automatically).

==Build and deploy it==
Do the following:
  * export the project from Eclipse as a web archive (File - Export - Web - WAR file)
  * deploy it to a servlet container (e.g. Tomcat)

==Setting up the GSA==
Add the Jive OneBox at "Serving > OneBox Modules" in the AdminUI. Normally you should use basic authentication. 
You may use the XML under GSA in the project. You have to change the provider URL.
