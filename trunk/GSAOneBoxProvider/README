GSA OneBox Provider

Setting up the project in Eclipse
================================================================================
Just check out the project in Eclipse; everything should be OK (sources should be build automatically).

Build and deploy it
================================================================================
Do the following:
- export the project from Eclipse as a web archive (File - Export - Web - WAR file)
- deploy it to a servlet container (e.g. Tomcat)

Setting up the GSA
================================================================================
Add the Jive OneBox? at "Serving > OneBox? Modules" in the AdminUI. Normally you should use basic authentication. You may use the XML under GSA in the project. You have to change the provider URL.

Configuration
================================================================================
log4j.properties
Please see the log4j documentation under: Apache Log4J

GSAOneBoxProvider.properties
#Version of the application

#Provider class used (has to be a fully qualified name to find the class by reflection)
Provider=com.qperior.gsa.oneboxprovider.implementations.jive.QPJiveProvider
#Security provider class used (has to be a fully qualified name to find the class by reflection)
SecurityProvider?=com.qperior.gsa.oneboxprovider.implementations.jive.QPJiveSecurityProvider

Known Issues
================================================================================
1. Monitoring is not implemented yet
One idea is to implement it with JMX.

2. The security interface has to be redesigned
The security interface has to be redesigned. It might be a good idea to combine both to combine it with the provider interface; but at the moment I decided to separate them.
