Release 1.0.0, June 25, 2012
================================

Introduction
------------
This is the initial release of the GSA OneBox Provider. Just use this solution as as template for your special situation.

Known limitations:
-----------------
1. Monitoring is not implemented yet
One idea is to implement it with JMX.
2. The security interface has to be redesigned
The security interface has to be redesigned. It might be a good idea to combine both to combine it with the provider interface; but at the moment I decided to separate them.

Advanced Configuration Properties
